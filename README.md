The NeuroBytes app communicates with NeuroBytes devices through the Network Interface Device (NID). Some of its features include:
-Monitor the membrane potential of a NeuroBytes board
-Adjust operating parameters (e.g. dendrite weighting, learning mode, etc...)
-Send network-wide commands (e.g. go into learning mode)

The app is currently in demo release.
